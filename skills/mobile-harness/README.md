> Portable operating instructions for AI agents controlling Android and iOS devices—locally or in the cloud.

Mobile Harness is a compact Markdown harness, not an agent runtime. Its primary
control path is Python's `mobilerun_core`, with optional client apps where
needed.

## Agent Setup Prompt

Copy paste it into your agent:

```text
Set up https://github.com/droidrun/mobile-harness for me.

Read `install.md` and follow the steps to install `mobile-harness`.
```

## Scope

- Android through `mobilerun-core` using local ADB with optional Portal, Portal HTTP-only, or cloud.
- iOS through `mobilerun-core` using `ios-portal` HTTP or cloud.

## Skill Install via npx (skills.sh)

Install the harness as an agent skill with the [skills CLI](https://skills.sh):

```bash
npx skills add droidrun/mobile-harness
```

Update an installed copy with `npx skills update` from the same project. First
use still requires the Python setup in `install.md`.

## Manual Install

Install the full public control API:

```bash
cd /path/to/mobile-harness
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install "mobilerun-core[local]"
.venv/bin/python -c "from mobilerun_core import Mobilerun"
```

Use Python 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13 to create the venv.

Tell agents which Python runtime to use:

```text
Use /path/to/mobile-harness/.venv/bin/python for mobile-harness.
```

Base `mobilerun-core` includes cloud support through `mobilerun-sdk`. The
`local` extra installs `mobilerun-core-local`, which `mobilerun-core` uses
internally for local Android and iOS backends. Agents should still import only
`mobilerun_core`.

## Primary API

```python
from mobilerun_core import Mobilerun

m = Mobilerun()
device = m.connect("<cloud-device-id>", backend="cloud")
device = m.connect("R5CT123456", backend="local-android-adb")
device = m.connect(backend="local-ios-http", url="http://127.0.0.1:6643")
device = m.connect(
    backend="local-android-http",
    url="http://127.0.0.1:18080",
    token="...",
)

device.ui()
device.screenshot()
device.start_app("com.android.settings")
```

After connecting, agents should inspect `device.capabilities` and use
`device.supports(...)` before optional operations.

`device.execute_script("<js>")` runs JavaScript in the device's foreground
Chrome tab and returns its JSON result. Cloud devices only; local backends
raise `UnsupportedOperation`. Gate it with
`device.supports("execute_script")`; the platform guides describe this key's
network-probe behavior and its two server-side errors.

## Common Device Helpers

Use these helpers through the `device` returned by `Mobilerun.connect(...)`:

- `device.find_nodes(...)` searches the accessibility tree. `any_contains=`
  matches case-insensitive substrings across text, content description,
  resource id, and accessibility identifier. Nodes may carry `offscreen: True`
  (outside the viewport; scroll to reach it) and `hidden: True` (reported not
  visible; scrolling alone may not reveal it). A missing flag is not proof of
  visibility.
- `device.tap_node(node)` taps the center of an accessibility node and raises
  if the node has no usable bounds. Before any bounds check, it raises a
  distinct error for a node flagged hidden unless the node is also offscreen.
- `device.tap_text("label")` taps the first on-screen, non-hidden match across
  text, description, resource id, and accessibility identifier. It raises a
  distinct error when matches exist but none are tappable on-screen.
- `device.scroll(direction, distance=0.5, ms=..., verify=False)` scrolls
  content-relative; `verify=True` returns whether the viewport actually moved.
- `device.scroll_until(text_contains=..., direction="down", max_swipes=10)`
  scrolls until a match is on-screen, returning the node or `None`. It stops
  early with `None` when the viewport stops moving; do not re-call it blindly.
- `device.type("text", clear=True)` clears the focused field before typing
  when the backend supports text input. `device.clear_input()` is available on
  local Android ADB and local iOS Portal HTTP.
- `device.list_apps()` excludes system apps by default. Pass
  `include_system_apps=True` when a full inventory is needed and supported.

## Cloud Mode

Cloud devices use the same `Mobilerun` facade:

```bash
export MOBILERUN_CLOUD_API_KEY="..."
export MOBILERUN_API_BASE_URL="https://api.mobilerun.ai/v1"
```

```python
from mobilerun_core import Mobilerun

m = Mobilerun()
device = m.connect("<cloud-device-id>", backend="cloud")
device.ui()
device.screenshot()
device.start_app("com.android.settings")
```

## Loading Model

Skill-based runtimes can load `SKILL.md`; all runtimes should start with
`AGENTS.md`. It routes agents to the smallest needed file:

- `platforms/android/GUIDE.md` for Android work.
- `platforms/ios/GUIDE.md` for iOS work.
- `platforms/<platform>/recovery/GUIDE.md` only when control fails.
- the credentials guide under `core/credentials` only when a credential or human-gated screen appears.
- `core/memory/GUIDE.md` only when reading or writing local agent-owned memory.
- `apps/android/<package>/CARD.md` or `apps/ios/<bundle-id>/CARD.md` only for the foreground app.
- `UPDATE.md` only when the session-start update (`git pull --ff-only` or `npx skills update`) fails.


## Local Android Modes

| ADB | Android Portal HTTP | Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| yes | yes | `backend="local-android-adb"`: core uses ADB and automatically uses Portal features when available. |
| yes | no | `backend="local-android-adb"`: core uses ADB-native control, UI, text input, screenshots, and app lifecycle. |
| no | yes | `backend="local-android-http"` with the user-provided Portal base URL and bearer token. |
| no | no | Blocked: ask the user to enable ADB or provide reachable Portal HTTP access. |

Android Portal HTTP-only means the agent already has both:

- a base URL such as `http://127.0.0.1:18080`
- a bearer token for `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

Without ADB, the harness cannot install, enable, port-forward, or fetch a token
for Portal.

## Local iOS Mode

Local iOS has one active capability mode:

- `iOS Portal HTTP`: `backend="local-ios-http"` with `MOBILERUN_IOS_PORTAL_URL` or an explicit URL. `GET /device/date`, `GET /state`, and `GET /vision/screenshot` must work.
- `Blocked`: no reachable iOS Portal. Start `ios-portal` check info: https://github.com/droidrun/ios-portal

The default local iOS Portal example is `http://127.0.0.1:6643`.

A second local iOS server exists: `mobilerun-ios --local <udid>`, default
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`, setup guide:
https://docs.mobilerun.ai/guides/connect-iphone. `backend="local-ios-http"`
speaks only the `ios-portal` contract and cannot connect to that server; do
not point it at port 8080. `platforms/ios/GUIDE.md` explains how to tell the
two apart.

## Local State

`memory/` and `credentials/` are local, ignored folders. The repository tracks only their rules/templates. Agents may write operational memory after reading `core/memory/GUIDE.md`.
